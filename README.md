Hi Professor Linderman,

To help guide you through this repository, you may find this helpful.
The main file we reccommend you run for the main functionality of our program is likelihood.py.
This will output the addresses of possible haplotypes and the number of edges pruned.
The other files run by themselves but may only output sub-problems that we solved along the way.

Thanks. Enjoy our code!
