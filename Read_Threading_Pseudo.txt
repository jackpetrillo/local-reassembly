Algorithm 2: Read Threading

1: for all reads:
2: 		read_kmers <- list of kmers in read
3:		for current_kmer in read_kmers:
4:			if current_kmer in graph:
5:				update/add edge from current_kmer to next_kmer
6:			else:
7:				create new edge
8:				update position_hash
9: return:
10: 	graph, position_hash
